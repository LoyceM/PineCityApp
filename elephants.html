                    <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                    <p>Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth and are divided into three species: the African savanna elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. African elephants are generally larger and have bigger ears shaped like the African continent, while Asian elephants have smaller, rounded ears. One of the most distinctive features of an elephant is its trunk, which serves multiple purposes such as breathing, smelling, grabbing objects, drinking water, and producing sound. Their tusks, made of ivory, are actually elongated teeth and are used for digging, defense, and stripping bark from trees.</p>
                    <p>These majestic creatures are known for their high intelligence and emotional depth. Elephants have excellent memories, can recognize themselves in mirrors, and show behaviors such as empathy, grief, and joy. They live in close-knit matriarchal family groups led by the oldest female, and they raise their young collectively. Communication is another fascinating aspect of elephant behaviorâ€”they use low-frequency infrasound to communicate over long distances and also rely on body language and touch to express themselves.</p>
                    
                    <p>Despite their strength and resilience, elephants face serious threats in the wild. Poaching for ivory, habitat destruction, and human-wildlife conflict have pushed some species, particularly the African forest elephant, to the brink of extinction. Conservation efforts around the world aim to protect elephant populations through anti-poaching laws, wildlife reserves, and public awareness campaigns. Elephants play a vital role in maintaining ecosystems, and protecting them is crucial for the health of the environment and future biodiversity.</p>
